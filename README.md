## HOW IT WORKS

npm install

npm run test

## TECHNOLOGY

I used Javascript with MOCHA and the CHAI library. I tried to follow a TDD approach writing the tests before the code to validate.
I decided to use SPLIT to remove the delimeters and separate the string into an array of numbers. After that I used reduce to sum the numbers inside the array, after checking the different conditions. 

I write the code step by step as requested without reading the next step before the previous one passed the test.
